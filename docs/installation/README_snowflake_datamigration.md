# [DRAFT] [WIP]

# [TODO]: Schema translation, and Data validation is yet to integerated

# Data Migration Tool User Guide - Data Transfer
* For Data Migration Tool introduction, please refer to [/README.md](/README.md)
* For Installation user guide, please refer to [/docs/installation/README.md](/docs/installation/README.md)

### Tool Features

* Initial release will support bulk load data transfer only. 
* Initial release will support Snowflake to BigQuery translation using BQ DTS, row and column validation of the data in source and target.

### Things to Take Note of


* If tables from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">multiple schemas</span> are to be migrated, create **separate config files** for each source schema.
* Current tool version supports only bulk load which is ideally done only once, note that the transfer shall take place by the process following upload of the config files.
* If there are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">new table additions to a batch/config file</span>, ideally create **a new config file** with a new table list even if rest details remain the same. If not followed, there might be multiple data transfer configs responsible for migrating the same tables.
* Note that reuploading the same configuration file or using a different config file for the same dataset and tables, will cause failures.
* **Note:** Snowflake connector proxy is a temporary stopgap solution until snowflake connector is released with run-time setup feature

### Prepare configuration file

The user uploads a configuration json file to **dmt-config-&lt;project-id-or-customer-name-given-in-deployment>**  bucket **data** folder which initiates data migration.

As the configuration is uploaded, a new file create/update trigger is sent to pub/sub which triggers the DAG **controller_dag**.

### Prerequisites 


* Target dataset creation to be done by the user/concerned team before uploading the configuration file.
* Snowflake Account URL 
* Snowflake JDBC URL
* Snowflake Warehouse name (which has access to required tables/schemas to migrate)
* Snowflake Storage Integeration which access to staging gcs buckets you wish to use for migration ([Steps](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-storage-integration))
* Snowflake file format (will be used for unloading data from snowflake to gcs) ([Steps](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format))
* Snowflake Oauth Client ID, Client Secret and Refresh Token ([Steps](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/HOW-TO-OAUTH-TOKEN-GENERATION-USING-SNOWFLAKE-CUSTOM-OAUTH))


### Data Migration Tool Deployment - Snowflake Data Migration

Data Migration deployment will take care of the workflow needed to perform


* Initial data load
* Data Validation using [DVT tool](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services-data-validator)
* Options to run DVT on cloud run and GKE airflow pod operator depending on scaling requirements.

Ensure that you have followed the steps to deploy Data Migration Tool architecture as mentioned in the [readme](/README.md) with the option of `_DATA_SOURCE=snowflake`

If you had previously only deployed translation architecture - you could run a data architecture deployment for snowflake migration with the below command provided the Terraform State files in remote GCS bucket from translation deployment are intact.


```
gcloud builds submit . --project ${SOURCE_PROJECT} \
--config cloudbuild_deploy.yaml \
--substitutions \
_DATA_SOURCE=snowflake
```


* Check for success messages in your Cloud Build Logs for deployment of
    * Google Cloud Storage
    * Cloud Pub/Sub
    * Cloud Composer
    * Cloud Run
    * Big Query


## Trigger Data Migration Tool 


* Data Migration 
* Data Validations
* SQL Validations

**unique_id:** name to uniquely identify the batches or DTS for this config file. 

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note</span>_ if the user opted for data migration, along with schema migration through the tool, this unique id should be the same as the one used in the schema migration config file.

**table_list_file:** file uploaded in GCS bucket same as the one used for uploading config file. This file should provide table names to be migrated from a particular schema in newlines. 
Eg: 
- DEPARTMENT
- EMPLOYEE
- SALARY
- HR_RECORDS


<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note</span> that this key only needs to be provided in case the user chooses to opt only for data migration through the tool (without schema translation). As such, tables structure is created by Snowflake Connector itself rather than the CompilerWorks schema migration feature from the tool. 

**_Tables in the CSV file should always be in the same case as how they exist in source Snowflake and ultimately match the contents of CSV/Excel file uploaded as validation parameters file in GCS._**

### Validation data in BigQuery

Composer DAG validation_dag will validate the data migrated to BQ. Results for DVT can be viewed in ``<PROJECT_ID>.dmt_logs.dmt_dvt_results``

Below query can be used to see the results:
```
SELECT * FROM `<project-id>.dmt_logs.dmt_dvt_results` where
-- validation_type='Column'
-- run_id = <transfer_run_id>
target_table_name = <target_table_name>
```

There are two ways to validate data - column or row. Validation_type given as column verifies count aggregation on the source and target tables. Validation_type given as row verifies hash of the rows based on the primary key. Hence for row validations, providing primary_key in Validation_config json is necessary.

Check the field descriptions section for detailed information on the keys in the configuration file.
